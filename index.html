        <h1><ins>AARUS RESTAURANT</ins></h1>
        <p>A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers. Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast-food restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury establishments.You can have a fantastic location, friendly servers, and good marketing; customers won’t give you a second look if your food is not up to par. That said, before focusing on anything else, ensure you serve high-quality food. Then comes menu pricing. Customers will flock to the competition if your food is too expensive for the location and the ingredients you’re offering. Research other similar restaurants in the area and see how much they charge for their dishes to get an idea of the local expectations. As much as possible, create seasonal menus. They lower food costs, so you can charge less for them while serving customers delicious local ingredients.</p>
